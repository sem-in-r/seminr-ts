# semints — needed / potential follow-ups

> Deferred work and known gaps vs seminr. Full parity reassessment vs seminr's NAMESPACE done 2026-07-04; every non-plotting exported feature shipped as of branch `parity` (`.claude/plans/PLAN.parity.md`) — what remains below is deliberately deferred or out of scope. Update this file when an item ships or a new deferral is decided.

## CBSEM/CFA follow-ups

- **Missing data (FIML / listwise options)** — seminr does not handle missing data for CBSEM (lavaan listwise default; mobi is complete). FIML would flip on a meanstructure and observed information — a significant estimator extension.
- **`higher_composite` for CBSEM** — unsupported in seminr (only `higher_reflective`); revisit only if seminr adds it.
- **Meanstructure / intercepts, bounds/constraints DSL, multi-group SEM** — absent from seminr's CBSEM surface; would be new scope beyond parity.
- **`csem2seminr` parser depth** — the shipped minimal parser covers `=~`/`<~`/`~` and rejects constraints/labels (as seminr's experimental importer effectively does); extend only if users bring richer lavaan syntax.

## PLS deliberate exclusions (not gaps)

- **`predict_pls`'s `reps` argument** — re-runs CV on the same fold assignment (no RNG inside `prediction_matrices`), so it only averages identical matrices; not ported.
- **`is_only_endogenous`** — NAMESPACE-exported but defined in `plot_dot.R` against the dot-graph coding; belongs to the plotting layer below.
- **`computeItCriteriaWeights` NaN handling** — deviates from seminr's NA-poisoned `min()` (its `na.rm` only guards the sum); we skip NaNs in both, honoring the na.rm intent (documented in the source).

## Out of scope (both estimators) — will have to get done eventually

1. **Plotting / presentation layer** — `dot_graph*`, themes (`seminr_theme_*`), `plot_htmt`, `plot_scores`, `plot_interaction` + `slope_analysis` (R-graphics simple-slopes plot), `save_plot`/`browse_plot`, and the `print.summary.*` console formatters. semints returns data objects; rendering belongs in a separate visualization package if ever.
2. **npm packaging / publishing** — checks before first release: package-name availability, LICENSE (seminr is MIT-compatible — verify attribution requirements for derived work), `files`/`exports` review, README install instructions.

## CBSEM technical debt / notes

- Parity tolerances are bounded by optimizer stopping error in double precision (plan Q7): fixtures use BFGS-polished lavaan optima; ridge-dominated matrices compare at mean-rel 5e-5. If fixtures are ever regenerated, keep the `optim.method="BFGS", control=list(reltol=1e-15)` override or the CBSEM parity tests will drift.
- `estimate_cfa` on the full C3 ECSI measurement model fails in seminr itself (non-PD latent covariance post-check) — not a semints bug; documented in plan Q5.
- Fixture quirk: R `NA` cells serialize as the string `"NA"` in fixture JSON; comparator handles it (`tests/cbsem/helpers.ts`).

## Process notes

- This file is committed (`.gitignore` carries a `!.claude/FUTURE.md` exception), unlike the plans in `.claude/plans/`, which stay gitignored and Sideways-synced.
